    "text": "The effects of climate change are rapidly becoming more apparent in our daily lives and in the data collected by researchers from the Southwestern Utah Group (SEUG) of National Parks. Over the past decade, there have been increasing reports of extreme weather, such as flooding, drought, hurricanes, and other natural diasasters. These natural diasasters have disrupted livelihoods and agricultural systems. In an effort by the Southwestern Utah Group (SEUG) of National Parks, researchers collected data around the Natural Bridges National Monument. This data included parameters, such as temperature, precipitation, volumetric water content in soil, and agricultural metrics (such as tree canopy coverage, herbaceous coverage, percentage of bare ground, plant litter, shrub coverage).\n\nIncrease in Extreme High Annual Temperatures\nFrom 2021 to 2024, the Natural Bridges National Monument had the highest temperatures recorded ranging from 24 to 26 degrees celsius.\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\nBeginning with data in 1983 and ending in 2024, each maximum annual temperature was compared to the maximum temperature between 1980 to 2000. The red color increases in intensity as the change in temperature increases. The most remarkable difference is seen by comparing 1983 and 2024.\n\n\nThe increase in extreme weather is striking with a steep increase in extreme temperature between 2021 to 2024. According to NASA, one-degree is global temperature change has a significant impact on the warming of oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses. For example, NASA stated that “A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average of the highest annual temperature per year was calculated. Alarmingly, there is a steep increase in extreme temperature between 2021 to 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging Precipitation Patterns\nPrecipitation patterns have also been changing in this region. As seen in the map below, there are fluctuations in the precipitation patterns from 1983 to 2024, but overall there is a downward trend in the average annual precipitation.\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\nBeginning with data in 1983 and ending in 2024, each average annual precipitation was compared to the average annual precipitation between 1980 to 2000. The blue color decreases in intensity as precipitation decreases. The most remarkable difference is seen by comparing 1983 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact on Precipitation and Water Content in Soil\nChanges in annual temperature and precipitation may have impacts on other environmental factors. In the Pearson Correlation Plots below, subtle relationships are seen between temperature and precipitation to volumetric water content (VWC) and water available in dry soil.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increasing intensity of the red color indicates a strong positive relationship while the blue color indicates an inverse relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increasing intensity of the red color indicates a strong positive relationship while the blue color indicates an inverse relationship.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson correlation matrix show the beginnings of the impact of changes in temperature and precipitation.\n\n\n                                                \nThis figure takes a closer look at the relationship between non-dry soil water availability during the summer.\n\n\nIn this parallel coordinates plot, the extreme values at above 3.5 show a relationship to a decrease in volumetric water content (VWC) in winter, spring, summer, and fall. According to Sumon Datta et. al., VWC can influence plant growth, soil temperature, transport of chemicals and groundwater recharge.\n\n\n                                                \nBy scrolling over the axis, a closer look at the relationship between extreme dry soil and VWC.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe data collected by the Southwestern Utah Group (SEUG) of National Parks shows the striking increase in extreme high temperatures, changes in precipitation, and subtle changes in water content in soil. These patterns have profound implications on our ecosystems. In an article by NASA, even one degree of temperature change can have catatrophic effects on the global ecosytem. Changes in temperature and precipitation may have negative impacts on our agricultural systems, which may also cause stress and strain on our future food sytems. It is critical that policy makers act urgently to reverse the effects of climate change.\n\n\nReferenes\n\nNASA. (n.d.). Effects - NASA science.
